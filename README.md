# Best practices in research data management and stewardship

The course is made up of seven sessions covering:

* Data management planning
* Data protection in research, requirements and responsibilities originating from GDPR
* Practicalities of data handling
* Exploratory analyses, reproducible manuscripts
* FAIR data principles
* Data publishing and archival

**Teaching Objectives:**

* To remember the research data lifecycle, to reveal data management planning as a form of decision making. Listing key factors that shape data management decisions.
* To learn about software tools that assist data management planning.
* To learn how the GDPR affects research and to reveal researchers' responsibilities when working with human-subject data.
* To learn about the record keeping requirements of the GDPR, and the tools that can be used for record keeping during the course of research.
* To learn about various data transfer channels, their advantages and disadvantages.
* To learn how to properly name files and organize research data.
* To learn about data integrity and its role in research data management.
* To learn how to make computational processing and analysis reproducible.
* To learn about FAIR data principles and their rationale, to reveal key indicators for FAIR'ness for a dataset.
* To learn how FAIR principles can be applied in data and results publishing on the example of data publishing at FAIRDOMHub.

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Learners can list key decision areas that underlie data management.
* Learners can use the Data Stewardship Wizard to record data management decisions for prospective projects.
* Learners can list requirements for accountable use of human data in research.
* Learners can use the Data Information System to keep record of research projects and sensitive human-subject data.
* Learners can setup their own safe working environment.
* Learners are able to ingest research data and perform key operations increasing the data integrity.
* Learners can tell whether or not their current practices on data handling results in FAIR data.
* Learners can publish their data and their results in accordance to FAIR principles.
* Learners can use FAIRDOMHub and similar platforms for their future work.

## Materials to be explored before attending the course

* Running example for course practicals ([PDF](resources/DM-DP_RunningExample.pdf)), and the paper by [GÃ©rard et.al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380961/) which is the actual study that inspired our running example
