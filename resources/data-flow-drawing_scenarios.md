### 1. Space Science – Observation of a Rare Atmospheric Event

You are a researcher at the University of Luxembourg’s Physics Department, collaborating with ESA and a university in Japan on “AuroraTrack,” a study of a rare atmospheric phenomenon over the Arctic.

ESA satellites captured high-resolution imagery and sensor data. The Japanese partner processed and published the raw satellite data in a public repository. You download the dataset and combine it with historical weather data from the Luxembourg Meteorological Institute.

You use image analysis scripts from a former PhD student to identify patterns. Ground-based observations from a citizen science network help validate your findings.

Your results will be submitted to ESA for internal review. If approved, they may be included in an ESA technical bulletin. Raw data remains publicly available, but your processed data will be part of ESA's internal database for intellectual property preservation.

### 2. History – Digitalization of Archival Documents

You are a postdoc in the Faculty of Humanities working on “LuxArchives,” digitizing and analyzing handwritten letters from the 19th century stored in the Luxembourg National Archives.

The archive provides scanned images. You use OCR and handwriting recognition models from a previous EU project to extract text. A linguist from the University of Vienna helps annotate the texts.

You store raw scans and extracted text on the university’s digital humanities server. Annotated datasets are used to build a searchable corpus.

Your findings will be published as a book with a university press. The annotated corpus will be made available via a public digital humanities portal, but raw scans will remain restricted due to copyright concerns.

### 3. Environmental Health – Reuse of Data from a Previous Project

You are a researcher at LCSB working on “ToxTrack,” investigating long-term exposure to environmental toxins. You reuse metabolomic profiles from a previous project and combine them with new data from an active cohort managed by a Swedish institute.

The Swedish team shares anonymized data via a secure API. You store both datasets on LCSB’s secure server and perform integrative analysis using lab-developed pipelines.

Your findings are being considered for patenting due to potential biomarker discovery. Until the patent process is complete, no data or code will be shared. If successful, a summary will be published in a biomedical journal, and data will be made available under controlled access.

### 4. Agricultural Technology – International Sensor Network

You are a PhD student at LIST working on “AgriSense,” monitoring soil moisture and crop health across Europe using IoT sensors. Partners in Spain, Germany, and Luxembourg collect data and upload it to a shared cloud platform.

You access Luxembourg-specific data and validate it using Copernicus satellite imagery. Machine learning models from a startup partner help predict irrigation needs.

Your results will be presented at an international agricultural tech conference. Sensor data will remain proprietary to the startup, but derived insights will be published in a white paper distributed to EU farming cooperatives.

### 5. Psychology - Cognitive decline study

You are a researcher in the Psychology Department working on “MindTrack,” studying cognitive decline. You collaborate with a Dutch institute managing a long-term cohort of elderly participants.

After approval, you receive encrypted neuropsychological and MRI data. You store it securely and integrate it with lifestyle data from a national health survey.

The project is in its planning phase. Data sharing agreements are still under negotiation, and publication plans are undecided. You are preparing a data management plan and GDPR documentation to support future dissemination.
